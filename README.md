# Web-Scraping-Challenge
Homework challenge using MongoDB and BeautifulSoup

For this challenge we were asked to write Python script using BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Reqests/Splinter to pull information from various websites and make a Mongo database. We were then tasked with taking that Mongo DB and making a local website rendering the information that was scraped using Python through a flask app and HTML (also using the css library.)

To accomplish this, I used Jupyter Notebooks to write my initial Python code (mission_to_mars.ipynb). Then I wrote it into a Python file (scrape_mars.py). After that, I wrote a flask app to pull the data from the Python file (app.py) and then wrote an HTML file to render into a website (index.html.)
